# Career Roadmap Knowledge Graph Generator

This project is a Streamlit application that generates a career roadmap as a knowledge graph, visualizing the learning path for a specific domain.

## Project Structure

The core logic resides in the `MultiAgentGraph/knowledge_graph_builder/` directory.

## How to Run

1.  **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd MultiAgentGraph/knowledge_graph_builder/
    ```
2.  **Ensure dependencies are installed**:
    If you haven't already, install the required Python packages (e.g., `streamlit`, `graphviz`, etc.). You can typically find these in `requirements.txt` within the `knowledge_graph_builder` directory.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Configure Environment Variables (Optional)**:
    If your agents require API keys or other sensitive information, create a `.env` file in the `MultiAgentGraph/knowledge_graph_builder/` directory.
    ```
    # Example .env content
    # API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    ```
    This file is ignored by Git to prevent sensitive data from being committed.
4.  **Run the Streamlit application**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    This will open the application in your web browser.

## Output

The application generates a visual knowledge graph. Additionally, a static PNG image of the graph is saved as `career_roadmap.png` in the `MultiAgentGraph/knowledge_graph_builder/` directory.

## Agent Flow

The knowledge graph generation process involves multiple specialized agents working in a coordinated pipeline to transform a user's request into a structured visual roadmap.

*   **User Input/Query**: The process begins with the user providing a specific query or topic for which they want a career roadmap.

*   **Orchestration Agent** (`app.py`): This is the central control unit. It receives the user's initial query from the Streamlit interface and intelligently delegates tasks to other agents in a predefined sequence. It manages the overall flow, ensuring each step is executed and its output is passed to the next relevant agent.

*   **Knowledge Extraction Agent** (`researcher.py`): Upon receiving a task from the Orchestration Agent, this agent is responsible for gathering raw, unstructured information. It might interact with various data sources (like web search, encyclopedias, etc.) to collect data relevant to the user's query and the phases of a career roadmap. Its output is raw extracted text.

*   **Knowledge Synthesis Agent** (`synthesizer.py`): This agent takes the raw information extracted by the Knowledge Extraction Agent. Its role is to process, filter, summarize, and refine this information, transforming it into more coherent and structured data points. This synthesized information is crucial for accurate graph construction.

*   **Knowledge Graph Builder Agent** (`mapper.py`): Receiving the refined data from the Synthesis Agent, this agent constructs the core knowledge graph. It identifies key concepts, phases, skills, and relationships, defining them as nodes and edges. It essentially translates the synthesized text into a structured graph data format (nodes and edges).

*   **Graph Export/Visualization Agent** (`graphviz_exporter.py`): This agent takes the structured knowledge graph data (nodes and edges) generated by the Knowledge Graph Builder Agent. It then uses the Graphviz library to convert this data into a visual representation. This includes generating the DOT language string and rendering it into two main outputs:
    *   **Interactive Streamlit Graph**: The DOT output is directly used by the Streamlit application to display an interactive version of the career roadmap in the web interface.
    *   **Static PNG File**: A static image file (`career_roadmap.png`) is saved in the `MultiAgentGraph/knowledge_graph_builder/` directory, providing a permanent, shareable visual output of the graph.

*   **Streamlit Application** (`app.py`): Beyond its role as the Orchestration Agent, `app.py` serves as the user interface for the entire system. It presents the input fields for user queries and displays the generated interactive knowledge graph. It integrates all the agent interactions behind the scenes to provide a seamless user experience.

*   **Display Knowledge Graph**: This is the final visual output, which is the rendered career roadmap, presented both interactively within the Streamlit application and as a static PNG image file.
